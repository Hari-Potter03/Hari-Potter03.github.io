A full-stack web application that predicts the likelihood of survival for Titanic passengers based on user-provided details. The project integrates a machine learning pipeline built with scikit-learn and XGBoost for classification,
served through a Flask REST API. The React frontend provides an intuitive interface for users to input passenger information and instantly receive a predicted survival probability and classification outcome.
This project showcases the deployment of a data-driven model in a modern web application, blending machine learning, API development, and frontend engineering into a seamless user experience.
